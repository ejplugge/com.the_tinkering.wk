 *     it does not extend to the name I gave to the app or my name/email address.
 *     Those are my trademarks.
 *     You are not allowed to use those, they belong to me exclusively. If you

 *     any name that includes my trademark or name.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *     Just pick a new name that does not include my name or trademark anywhere
 *     in it. It's fine to acknowledge in documentation that the app derives from
 *     my work, and/or to reference my app. But DO NOT actually use my name or trademark
 *     for any part of your app.
